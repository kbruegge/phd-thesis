# Data

This folder contains the datasets used for this paper.

There are Crab observations from the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray space telescope,
as well as from four ground-based gamma-ray telescopes (MAGIC, VERITAS, FACT, H.E.S.S.).

These are the "inputs" for the analysis scripts in this repository,
the data files prepared with other codes.

The data is in FITS format. See https://gamma-astro-data-formats.readthedocs.io/ .

A description is in the paper, and each folder also contains a `README` with some notes.
