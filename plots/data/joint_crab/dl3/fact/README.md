# FACT Open Data Release

The FACT open data release contains 10.6 hours of Crab Nebula observations taken
in October 2013 by the First G-APD Cherenkov Telescope (FACT).

FACT is located on the Roque des los Muchachos on the Canary island of La Palma
off the west coast of Africa. It is an imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescope
protoyping silicon-photomultipliers.

FACT data is stored in FITS files from the raw data level up to higher levels
containing the results of our analysis. All of the data used here is publicly
available, including the simulated data used for gauging the instrument
response. For more information about the data visit
