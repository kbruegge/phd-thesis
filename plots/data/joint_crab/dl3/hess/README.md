# HESS data

This folder contains the [H.E.S.S.](https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/HESS/) data
used in this paper.

It consists of 4 Crab Nebula observations, each 28 min in duration with the
H.E.S.S. 1 telescopes from 2004.

As you can see in `make.py`, this is a copy of the 4 Crab runs from the H.E.S.S.
first public test data release
([webpage](https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/HESS/pages/dl3-dr1/),
[zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/1421099)).

For a detailed description, see the H.E.S.S. DL3 DR1 release notes document, and
specifically for the Crab Nebula dataset and analysis, also this paper.

Below we copy the `README.txt` file from the H.E.S.S. DL3 DR1 that contains the
terms of use for this data.

data level 3 of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) and IACT
open-source science tool development, to enlarge the community involved in
IACT data analysis.

No scientific publications may be derived from the data. Using the data
for new claims about the astrophysical sources is not permitted.
