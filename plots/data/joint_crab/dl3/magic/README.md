# MAGIC data

[MAGIC](https://magic.mpp.mpg.de/) is a system of two 17 m diameter IACT located
in the Canary island of La Palma, Spain at the Roque de Los Muchachos
Observatory (2200 m above the sea level).

2 runs (data taking chunks) of 20 min are provided for this project, from the
dataset used in the 2016 MAGIC performance paper
([2016APh....72...76A](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016APh....72...76A)). They
consist of two obsevations of the Crab Nebula under good atmospheric conditions,
with Zenith range between 12 and 24 deg (for a Zenith range below 35 deg MAGIC
can achieve an energy threshold as low as 50 GeV).

## License

The MAGIC data here provided as part of this repository are in a preliminary data format.     
They are only meant for the user to reproduce the results within the publication
connected with this repository. It is not allowed to use the data outside of
this scope e.g. to make any claim on the source in any scientific context
(papers, conferences).

## Technical Details

The observations are performed in the so-called ``wobble`` mode with the Crab at
0.4 degrees from its nominal position.     

Event lists and IRFs and generated after a theta2 cut of 0.02 deg^2.
